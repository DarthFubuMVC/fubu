Storyteller2 Integration

* This template does not create a Storyteller ISystem.  If your system under test requires
  custom bootstrapping and teardown, it's suggested that you add your own implementation of
  Storyteller.Engine.ISystem to your testing assembly 

* In your rakefile, you may want to change the Storyteller tasks according to the options at
  http://fubuworld.com/fuburake/storyteller2-integration/

* Fixture classes are generally kept in the Fixtures namespace, but this is only an idiom,
  not a requirement.  There is a standin MathFixture there you will want to remove.

* Storyteller2 tests are assumed to be in the /Tests folder, but each test at this time
  will need to be under a suite folder.  There is a single standin test as part of this
  template
